## 1. üéØ AI Chart Analyst (AIChartSummary Component)

### Overview
Real-time AI analysis overlay that appears on the chart displaying contextual market commentary.

### Current Implementation
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Location**: `components/AIChartSummary.tsx`
- **Trigger**: Auto-generated every time chart data updates (with 1000ms debounce)
- **Display**: Floating overlay (top-left of chart)

### How It Works
1. Collects active technical indicators from user selection
2. Gathers recent pattern opportunities detected
3. Constructs a detailed prompt with context
4. Generates a **40-word max neutral summary**
5. Displays in overlay with loading state

### Key Features
‚úÖ Context-aware (knows current pair, timeframe, active indicators)  
‚úÖ Debounced to prevent API spam  
‚úÖ Shows loading state  
‚úÖ Maintains trading neutrality ("Focus on chart story")  
‚úÖ Responsive to indicator changes  

### Issues & Gaps
‚ùå **Summary regenerates frequently** - Every chart data update triggers new analysis (wasteful)  
‚ùå **Hardcoded 40-word limit** - No flexibility for detailed vs. quick summaries  
‚ùå **No caching** - Same market state might be analyzed multiple times  
‚ùå **API cost** - Every candle update = new API call (~1 call/sec in live mode)  
‚ùå **Limited context** - Only uses last 2 opportunities, misses broader patterns  

### Recommendations
- Implement smart caching: only regenerate on significant price moves (e.g., >1% change)
- Add user preference for summary length (quick/detailed)
- Cache summaries for identical market conditions (same indicators, same price range)
- Reduce API calls: generate on indicator toggle or pair change only

---

## 2. üí¨ AI Assistant (AIAssistant Component)

### Overview
Interactive Q&A interface where users ask educational questions about trading concepts and chart analysis.

### Current Implementation
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Location**: `components/AIAssistant.tsx`
- **User Interaction**: Text input + 4 example prompts
- **Context Provided**: Current pair, interval, latest OHLCV data

### How It Works
1. User asks a question or clicks an example prompt
2. Full prompt is constructed with chart context
3. AI generates educational response
4. Results displayed in response box
5. Input cleared for next question

### Example Prompts Built-In
- "Explain what a 50-day moving average is."
- "What does RSI mean?"
- "Based on the current price, what is a possible short term outlook?"
- "Describe a common pattern in candlestick charts."

### Key Features
‚úÖ Provides financial educational context (not advice)  
‚úÖ Pre-built example questions for UX guidance  
‚úÖ Clear error handling with user messaging  
‚úÖ Loading state during API calls

- **Response Format**: Structured JSON (summary + articles array)
- **Article Limit**: 5 articles max

### How It Works
1. Component mounts or pair changes
2. Calls `geminiService.fetchNews(pair.name)`
3. Gemini generates 3-5 articles based on prompt
4. Parses JSON response for structure
5. Displays summary + clickable article links
6. Links open in new tabs

### API Integration Details
```typescript
// Structured response with JSON schema
{
  summary: "Brief market context summary",
  articles: [
    { title: "Article Headline", uri: "https://..." },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Key Features
‚úÖ Structured API response with schema validation  
‚úÖ Pair-specific news fetching  
‚úÖ Clean link formatting with domain display  
‚úÖ Summary above articles for quick context  
‚úÖ External link handling (target="_blank")  
‚úÖ Error handling with loading states  

### Issues & Gaps
‚ùå **AI-generated news, not real** - Gemini is making up article titles/URLs  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Links likely broken** - Generated URIs probably don't exist  
‚ùå **No caching** - Refetches on every pair change  
‚ùå **Limited to 5 articles** - Arbitrary limit  
‚ùå **No date/source credibility** - Can't verify age or authenticity  
‚ùå **Single topic** - Only searches pair name, missing sentiment/technicals  
‚ùå **No sentiment analysis** - Bullish/bearish classification missing  

### Recommendations
- **CRITICAL**: Integrate real news API (NewsAPI, CoinTelegraph API, etc.)
- Add sentiment classification (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- Implement caching with TTL (e.g., 1 hour per pair)
- Add article date/recency filtering
- Include source reliability scoring
- Add news-triggered alerts for major developments

## 4. üîç Opportunity Analyzer (opportunityAnalyzer.ts)

### Overview
Pattern and indicator detection engine that identifies trading opportunities algorithmically.

### Current Implementation
- **Type**: Client-side heuristic engine
- **Location**: `lib/opportunityAnalyzer.ts`
- **Output**: `Opportunity[]` array with type, title, description
- **Integration**: Runs on every chart data update

### Detected Patterns (5 types)

| Pattern | Detection Method | Signal Type |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Bullish Engulfing** | Candlestick reversal (prev bearish + current bullish encompassing) | Pattern |
| **Bearish Engulfing** | Candlestick reversal (prev bullish + current bearish encompassing) | Pattern |
| **RSI Oversold** | RSI < 30 crossover | Indicator |
| **RSI Overbought** | RSI > 70 crossover | Indicator |
| **BB Squeeze** | Bollinger Band width < 10% of 20-period low | Volatility |
| **MACD Bullish Cross** | MACD line crosses above signal line | Indicator |
| **MACD Bearish Cross** | MACD line crosses below signal line | Indicator |

### How It Works
```
processedChartData ‚Üí analyzeOpportunities() 
  ‚Üì
  Checks last 2 candles + indicators
  ‚Üì
  Matches against 7 predefined patterns
  ‚Üì
  Returns array of matched opportunities
  ‚Üì
  OpportunityFeed displays with highlight on chart
```

### Key Features
‚úÖ Real-time pattern detection  
‚úÖ Multiple pattern types (technical, volatility)  
‚úÖ Index-linked to chart data for highlighting  
‚úÖ Runs efficiently on client-side  
‚úÖ No external dependencies  
‚úÖ Opportunity descriptions are clear  

### Issues & Gaps
‚ùå **Limited to 7 patterns** - Missing other key setups (double tops, head & shoulders, support breaks)  
‚ùå **Hard-coded thresholds** - RSI 30/70, BB 10% - no customization  
‚ùå **Single-candle lookback** - Misses multi-candle patterns  
‚ùå **No probability scoring** - All patterns equally weighted  
‚ùå **No historical context** - Doesn't learn from past pattern success  
‚ùå **Lagging signals** - Detects after pattern fully formed  
‚ùå **Not AI-powered** - Pure heuristics, no machine learning  
‚ùå **Documentation labeled "mock"** - Suggests temporary implementation  

### Recommendations
- Expand pattern library (head & shoulders, triangles, support/resistance breaks)
- Add probability scoring based on historical win rates
- Implement customizable thresholds per user preference
- Add leading indicators (precursor signal detection)
- Cache pattern definitions to reduce computation
- Consider ML-based pattern recognition (TensorFlow.js)
